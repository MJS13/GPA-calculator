# GPA-calculator
This is a project of the university of St. Gallen of the course programming â€“ introduction level.  The goal of the project was to create a program which calculates the GPA. Thanks to the program the user is able to enter for each semester his marks. The program calculates then the GPA. As an extra the program plots a Graph, which shows the development over the past semesters.   The program is inspired by the fact that at the university of St. Gallen not every mark has the same weighting. This leads to the problem, that if you want to calculate your GPA, it is not possible to use the commune formula: sum of marks divided by the number of marks. The fact, that for the calculation of the GPA it is necessary to take the value into account, makes the calculation rather cumbrous. Thanks to the GPA-calculator the user is able to enter his marks and its value. The calculator will provide a GPA, which has taken the value into consideration.
